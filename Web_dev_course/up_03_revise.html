<h1>Here I start with projecting the Coffee and its price</h1><br>

<p> <strong>Coffee</strong>, a <em>beloved beverage</em> brewed from roasted and ground coffee beans, is globally renowned for its stimulating effect due to its caffeine content, making it a popular choice for a morning pick-me-up or an afternoon boost. Originating in Ethiopia, coffee boasts a rich history and diverse brewing methods, ranging from traditional drip coffee to espresso-based drinks like lattes and cappuccinos. Its distinct aroma and flavor profile, which can vary depending on the bean origin and roast level, have cemented coffee as a cultural staple in many societies, often enjoyed in social settings and associated with moments of focused productivity.</p>
